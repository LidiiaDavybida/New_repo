Life is like a boat in the bottle
Try to sail, You can't with no air
Day by day it only gets harder
Try to scream but nobody cares

Through the glass you see the same faces
Hear the voices play fade a drum
When your life's a boat in a bottle
You're surrounded, drifting alone

Don't leave me now
Stay another day
With me
